[x] Assumption: there is no need to free everything on exit().

Set of map characters: 0, 1, N, S, E, W, " ".

N, S, E, W is where player is and his initial orientation.

[ ] There must be one player.

[%] Map must be enclosed in ones.

[%] Parse errors look like this: "Error\nFoo bar\n".

Effectively, minimal map is 3x3.

[ ] Map content is last.

[ ] Order of config is not specified.

[ ] Config entries may be separated by newlines.

[ ] Config info in an entry may be separated by any amount of spaces.

[x] Simplification: space is handled as a one.

[x] Whether map is a rectangle or not is not specified.

Simplification: map frame should be thick.

	Not ok:

		110
		1N1
		111

	Ok:

		111
		1N1
		111

? Newline at the end? Optional.
[x] Fix me: new lines are assumed.

? Nothing is said that config entries need to be terminated by newline.
