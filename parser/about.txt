Assumption: there is no need to free everything on exit()

Assumption: there are exactly 6 config entries: "SO", "NO", "EA", "WE", "F", "C"

Valid map characters must be in set '0', '1', 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', ' '

'\n' or '\r' is a valid line break

'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W' determine player initial position and orientation

To-do: there must be exactly one player

Test me: “The map must be closed/surrounded by walls”. Test me: current rules:

	Top must be 1
	Bottom must be 1
	Left side must exist and be 1
	Right side must be 1 and “cliffs” must be 1
	Lines may not be empty

To-do: map content must be last

To-do: order of other config entries is not specified

To-do: config entries must be separated by any count of newlines greater than 0

To-do: config element in an entry must be separated by any natural number of spaces ' ', including zero

Simplification: spaces in map are handled as ones. 

Whether map is a rectangle or not is not specified

Simplification: newline at the end of config is expected

Note: nothing is said that config entries must be terminated by newlines

To-do: NO(rth), SO(uth), WE(st), EA(st), F(loor), C(eiling):

	^(NO|SO|WE|EA)( )*${path}
	^(F|C)( )*${red}( )*,( )*${green}( )*,( )*${blue}

To-do: parser is interested in filling following fields:

	In t_main: map, map_H, map_W

	In t_mlx: wall_N, wall_S, wall_E, wall_W

To-do: fd is not need in cub main

Test me: file extension must be "cub"

	Fix me: lafjdslfj.aflafdjal.cub doesn't work

Test me: given config file must exist

Test me: errors are thrown properly

To-do: throw error on unknown config entry keys

To-do: throw error on duplicate config entry keys

Perhaps: add more user friendly error messages

To-do: add more tests
